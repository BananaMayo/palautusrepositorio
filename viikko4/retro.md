#### Continue/Stop/Start/More of/Less of
This retrospective method obtains feedback on team process to learn what should be adjusted and what the 
team should continue with as it moves forward. This method contains three steps, first divide a drawn circle into
5 sections and write on each sections the words "start", "stop", "continue", "more of" and "less of". The second 
step is to ask the team questions for each section, like "What have we not done yet, that's something we should
start doing?". The third step is to comment those sections. Pros for this method is that it's very simple to 
perform and doesn't require any special equipment nor knowledge to complete. The disadvantage of this method
is that it could be to much focused in projects and tasks.
#### Mad, Sad, Glad
The mad sad glad retro method focuses to be more emotionally-aware to help build a positive team dynamic, and 
gives the opportunity to reflect on issues and agreements from a different perspective. This method is a great
way to improve job satisfaction and team morale. The way this works is that everyone on the team gets to share
what made them feel frustrated (mad), disappointed (sad) and happy(glad).
